 <h2>Buildapp - Create executables with SBCL or CCL</h2>

<div id='summary'>
 <p>Buildapp is an application for SBCL or CCL that configures and saves an
   executable Common Lisp image. It is similar
   to <a href='http://www.cliki.net/cl-launch'>cl-launch</a> and
   hu.dwim.build. Buildapp is available under
   a <a href='#license'>BSD-style license</a>. 

The latest version is 1.5.6, released on November 7th, 2015.

<a name='installation'><h2>Installation</h2></a>

<p>Buildapp does not require any libraries. To compile it you simply
  run <tt>make install</tt>.  This will compile and install versions
  of buildapp with whichever of SBCL and/or CCL are available on your
  system.  To later call a particular version of buildapp either call
  the specific executable (i.e., <tt>buildapp-sbcl</tt>
  or <tt>buildapp-ccl</tt>) or call the <tt>buildapp</tt> executable
  which will dispatch depending on the value of the <tt>LISP</tt>
  environment variable (defaulting to SBCL).  By default, it is
  installed in
  <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt>; to use another location,
  use <tt>make&nbsp;DESTDIR=/path&nbsp;install</tt>.

<p>You can also create the buildapp binary by loading the buildapp
  system with asdf and running <tt>(buildapp:build-buildapp)</tt>.


<a name='example'><h2>Example Use</h2></a>

<p>Here's a small application:

<pre class=code>
$ <b>buildapp \
    --eval '(defun main (argv) (declare (ignore argv)) (write-line "Hello, world"))' \
    --entry main \
    --output hello-world</b>
[undoing binding stack and other enclosing state... done]

done]

$ <b>./hello-world</b>

</pre>

  interactive debugger.)

  (:use #:cl))

(in-package #:utils)

(defun main (argv)

<a name='overview'><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Here is the usage output of buildapp:

<pre>
Usage: buildapp --output OUTPUT-FILE [--flag1 value1 ...]

Required flags:
  --output OUTPUT-FILE      Use OUTPUT-FILE as the name of the executable
                              to create

Entry-point flags:
  --entry NAME              Use the function identified by NAME as the
                              executable's toplevel function. Called
                              with SB-EXT:*POSIX-ARGV* as its only
                              argument. If NAME has a colon, it is
                              treated as a package separator,
                              otherwise CL-USER is the implied
                              package.
  --dispatched-entry DNAME  Specify one possible entry function, depending
                              on the name of the file that is used to
                              start the application. The syntax of
                              DNAME is APPLICATION-NAME/ENTRY-NAME. If the
                              name used to start the executable matches
                              APPLICATION-NAME, use ENTRY-NAME as the
                              entry point. This can be used to choose
                              one of many possible entry points by
                              e.g. symlinking names to the application
                              executable. If APPLICATION-NAME is empty, the
                              specified ENTRY-NAME is used as a default
                              if no other application names match. There
                              may be any number of dispatched entry points,
                              but only one default.

Action flags:
  --load FILE               Load FILE. CL:*PACKAGE* is bound to the CL-USER
                              package before loading
  --load-system NAME        Load an ASDF system identified by NAME
  --require NAME            Use CL:REQUIRE to load NAME
  --eval CODE               Use CL:EVAL to evaulate CODE. The code is read
                              with CL:READ-FROM-STRING in the CL-USER package

There may be any number of load/load-system/require/eval flags. Each
is executed in command-line order before creating an executable.

Load path flags:
  --load-path DIRECTORY     When handling a --load, search DIRECTORY for
                              files to load
  --asdf-path DIRECTORY     When handling a --load-system, search DIRECTORY
                              for ASDF system files to load
  --asdf-tree DIRECTORY     When handling a --load-system, search DIRECTORY
                              and all its subdirectories for ASDF system
                              files to load
  --manifest-file FILE      When handling a --load-system, read a list of
                              ASDF system file pathnames from FILE as
                              possible matching systems.

There may be any number of load-path/asdf-path/asdf-tree/manifest-file
flags. They take priority in command-line order.

Other flags:
  --compress-core           Compress the core or executable; requires
                              configuration support in SBCL
  --core-only               Make a core file only, not an executable
  --dynamic-space-size MB   Pass a --dynamic-space-size option to SBCL
                              when building; value is megabytes
  --help                    Show this usage message
  --logfile FILE            Log compilation and load output to FILE
  --sbcl PATH-TO-SBCL       Use PATH-TO-SBCL instead of the sbcl program
                              found in your PATH environment variable

<a name='limitations'><h2>Limitations</h2></a>

<p>Buildapp is limited in scope. It aims to make the following steps
  easy:

<ul>
<li> Define an application environment by loading files, loading ASDF
  systems,  evaluating code, and using CL:REQUIRE
<li> Dump an executable image with an arbitrary startup function
</ul>

<p>By design, it does <i>not</i> handle the following tasks:

<ul>
<li> Initialization tasks at app startup
  (use <a href='http://l1sp.org/sbcl/sb-ext:*init-hooks*'>SB-EXT:*INIT-HOOKS*</a>
  for that)
<li> Debugger management (use <tt>*DEBUGGER-HOOK*</tt> for that)
<li> Command-line processing (use a library such
  as <a href='http://common-lisp.net/project/qitab/'>COMMAND-LINE-ARGUMENTS</a>
  for that)
<li> Obtaining libraries
  (use <a href='http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/'>clbuild</a>,
  <a href='http://libcl.com/'>LibCL</a>, <a href='http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-librarian/'>cl-librarian</a>,
  asdf-install, etc. for that)
</ul>


<a name='implementation'><h2>Implementation</h2></a>

<p>Buildapp works like this:

<ol>

<li>It processes the command-line and creates an object that
  captures the command-line requirements: the output file, any
  eval/load/load-system/require actions, the entry function, etc.

<li>It creates a new Lisp file (the <i>dumpfile</i>) with all the
  commands needed to implement the command-line options.

<li>It runs either "sbcl"
  with <a href='http://l1sp.org/sbcl/sb-ext:run-program'><tt>sb-ext:run-program</tt></a>
  or "ccl" with
  <a href='http://ccl.clozure.com/ccl-documentation.html#External-Program-Dictionary'><tt>ccl:run-program</tt></a>.
  In either case lisp is invoked with no init files (it doesn't read
  user or system rc files) and loads the dumpfile:

<ol>

<li>The first few commands of the dumpfile establish a specialized
  loading environment:

<ul>
<li> The debugger is changed
  with <a href='http://l1sp.org/sbcl/sb-ext:*invoke-debugger-hook*'><tt>*invoke-debugger-hook*</tt></a>
  to simply quit with a special exit code instead of entering the
  normal debugger (in CCL the same behavior is accomplished using
  the <tt>:application</tt> and <tt>:error-handler</tt> arguments
  to <tt>ccl:save-application</tt>)
<li> Most output (ASDF system compilation output, low-level error
  messages, etc) is redirected to a log stream; that stream can be
  directed to a file with the <tt>--logfile</tt> argument
<li> Stale compiled files are automatically recompiled with an <tt>:around</tt>
  method on <tt>asdf:perform</tt>
</ul>

<li>There are some sanity checks: Is the
  output file writable? Does this version of sbcl support the
  required <tt>:save-runtime-options</tt> argument?

<li>The dumpfile performs the eval/load/load-system/require
  actions. Each operation is evaluated in the <tt>cl-user</tt> package
  and with a fresh binding of <tt>sb-ext:*invoke-debugger-hook*</tt>
  in sbcl or <tt>ccl::*debugger-hook*</tt> in ccl to the buildapp
  debugger function. If the binding is modified, the new value is
  saved.

<li>The dumpfile clears itself out of the environment:

<ul>
<li> Remove extra ASDF methods
 with <a href='http://l1sp.org/cl/remove-method'><tt>remove-method</tt></a>
<li> Reset the debugger hook to the saved value or NIL if no value was
  saved.
<li> Delete the dumpfile package
 with <a href='http://l1sp.org/cl/delete-package'><tt>delete-package</tt></a>
</ul>

<li>The dumpfile then creates an executable
with <a href="http://l1sp.org/sbcl/sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die"><tt>save-lisp-and-die</tt></a>
in sbcl or
<a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter4.9.html"><tt>ccl:save-application</tt></a>
in ccl. This ends the lisp subprocess.
</ol>

<li> It deletes the dumpfile.
</ol>

<p> The ASDF central registry is temporarily extended with
  the <tt>--asdf-path</tt> and <tt>--asdf-tree</tt> arguments at load
  time, and reverts back to the default central registry value after
  that. To avoid conflicts with this behavior, changes to the central
  registry should be done at startup time instead of application load
  time.
